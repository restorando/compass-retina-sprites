## Compass Retinator

This Compass extension will allow you to create retina ready sprites from scratch. Just drop your images on the right folders, type some Compass mumble jumble and you are ready to go!

##Installation

    gem installl compass-retinator

Now do a require in your Compass <kbd>config.rb</kbd>

    require 'compass-retinator'

## How to use it?

First thing to do is drop your images on the right folders. In this case I have set two folders <kbd>icons</kbd> and <kbd>icons-sprites</kbd> inside my image folder.

Next, we need to tell Compass where those image are. Add this line to <kbd>variables.sass</kbd> or somewhere else

    $sprites:        sprite-map("icons/*.png")
    $sprites_retina: sprite-map("icons-sprites/*.png")


Now we need to init awesomeness, add this line to your project:

    @import "compass_retinator"

## Using the extension

You can pass several parameters to obtain the right result, some valid options are:

    // This will import plain.png
    .plain
      +sprite(plain)

    // This will import boat.png, boat_hover.png and boat_active.png
    .boat
      +sprite(boat, $hover_state: true, $active_state: true)

    // This will import console.png plus 40px of padding on the sides
    .console
      +sprite(console, $spacing: 40px)

    // This will import people.png and it will not set any dimension on this elements
    .people
      +sprite(people, $dimensions: False)

## Common Issues

### The sprite position is wrong

Please be sure that your icons scale proportionally. If the non-retina icons are **16x16** your retina icons must be **32x32** and not **30x32** and definitely not **45x34**

### I'm getting a _compass can't convert nil into string_ error

You're probably running a rails app. This is a weird issue with compass-rails. For some reason compass-rails does not create the sprites on demand and doesn't understand the `sprite-map`.

One workaround is to tell Compass to re-declare your sprites assets, so add this line at the top of your variables:

    @import "icons/*.png"
    @import "icons-sprites/*.png"

### The smart layout doesn't seems to work properly

Unfortunately Compass doesn't support extra options with this layout. Try to use the default layout or the horizontal layout.

### When I add some _spacing_ to my sprite the sprite position is not right

Please, keep in mind, if you are adding extra padding around the sprite item, you will also need to tell Compass to add some extra space on every sprite item. Just past the varible `$spacing: XXpx`

    $sprites:        sprite-map("icons/*.png", $spacing: 10px)
    $sprites_retina: sprite-map("icons-sprites/*.png", $spacing: 20px)
